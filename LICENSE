Pear eLicense v1.0

Terminology:
pastaOS - the OS we made
We/our/us - Pear Computer LLC.
End user - you and other people
Pear ID - The account for every Pear service

Cans:
Use pastaOS
Install apps and other things into pastaOS

Can'ts:
Sell our OS without written consent from us
Modify our OS with the intent of ripping people off by selling a pastaOS-based bootleg or making a bootleg in any form
Share pastaOS without our written consent
Using our OS to break the law (this likely won't be easily enforced)

Punishments:
Bootlegging, selling our OS without our consent, sharing it without our consent, and breaking the law without our consent will either result in the end user's Pear ID being terminated and/or being reported to the proper authorities (most likely Pear ID termination), but an appeal can be made if one has enough non-dubious evidence that the end user should be unbanned (unbanning is unlikely considering our strict narrow reasons for approving appeal requests and unbanning the end user).

How to get consent:
First, you have to sign an NDA we send you after contacting the-new-devil@proton.me, then you pay 15 SOL to the Solana wallet at 6WdehUuzCnh623gAW7FqUHRyeKpGQKvoxLmdG4QbZpAB, then you must sign a license agreement, and finally, you have to provide reasons why you want to access the code of pastaOS and wait to get approved (we don't just give access to anyone, and if you are rejected, you are still bound by the NDA that will state that unless you are developing apps or helping others develop apps or otherwise not sharing the .sb3 file to everyone, you must NOT share how pastaOS works if you are sharing it or selling it nor using it to get an unfair advantage ahead of us, but any other use besides that is allowed as well).
