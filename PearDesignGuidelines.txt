Many people have likely wondered how we at Pear design UIs and UXes. Well, these design guidelines will tell you how we make sleek, modern, and minimalistic UIs.

Dos:
Use flat rectangles and circles, flat, straight lines, and sans serif fonts like the Sans Serif font of Scratch and TurboWarp.
Make sure any pasta or noodle dish wallpapers have a top-down view of the dish without showing other dishes in the background.
Make sure all icons are functional to some extent.

Don'ts:
Don't use gradients. It just makes it look outdated and clunky.
Don't clutter it with too many icons.
Don't use too many stock images and sounds. A logo, startup sound (like the Mac startup chime (a bong sound)), and/or any food-related wallpapers or any other royalty-free wallpapers will work.
Don't use part of your username on websites like Scratch as part of the OS name. An example of what would break this would be BambusOS. The user who made it has "bambus" in the username. pastaOS, on the other hand, does NOT use the names "micro", "boy", nor "microboy" anywhere in the name.
Don't add icons that don't do anything if they aren't placeholders for a more functional icon.
